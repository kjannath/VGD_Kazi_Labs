# VGD_Kazi_Labs
 Labs for Intro to VGD  

Lab 1  
Description: A main scene with multiple instances of other scenes. I made the main scene the main character of the game, which is a fish. The other scenes are secondary characters and also the background.
    
My vision: I am recreating a game that I used to play when I was a child: You start off as the small fish and you have to eat fish that are even smaller in order to grow to the largest fish. You have to avoid getting eaten by the larger fish that come and go.  
  
Questions:  
How do I code the characters to move?  
What is the point of having multiple scenes/ What is a scene?

Lab 2  
Description: A bird that can move up and down with user input. User must click up arrow or down arrow to control it. There are also branches that are coming towards the bird. The bird and branches both have speed as an exported value.  
  
My vision: I am envisioning a game where a bird must dodge obstacles that come its way as it flies through the sky.  
  
Questions: 
How can I spawn obstacles infinitely?

Lab 4
Description: A dummy player represented by a CSG capsule is able to navigate its 3D environment. The environment is a river, and the player must jump from rock to rock in order to reach the other side of the river.

Questions:
How can I create a game where the camera perspective changes with the users control?
